 ## Hello eveyone and welcome to my QA portfolio! 

# Hi there! I' am Lina - a passionate bug hunter 🕵️‍♀️ 
I love finding bugs so others don't have to! 
After a long journey of late nights and lots of coffee, I've found my passion in QA. 
I've taught myself everything I know about it from scratch and I'm proud of how far I've come. 
I'am so exited to bring value to a team and make digital experiences better and smoother for everyone.

### My next big goal is... to grow into an Automation QA role and make real impact in a tech team I belive in 🚀✨

                                                                   <p align="center">  * My First Automation Goals🎯 
1. Understand the basics of test automation
Learn what test automation is, when to use it, and how it can help make testing faster and more reliable.
2. Study how to work with locators
Practice finding elements on a page using IDs, class names, XPath, and CSS selectors — the foundation of interacting with any web element.
3. Write simple automated test scripts
Start creating small scripts that can open a web page, click buttons, fill out forms, and check if elements appear correctly.
