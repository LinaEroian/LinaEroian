## Hello eveyone and welcome to my QA portfolio! 
## <p align="center"> 💡 About Me
I'am Lina - a passionate bug hunter 🕵️‍♀️ 
After exploring different paths and asking myself what kind of work makes me feel alive, I found the answer in Quality Assurance.
I love diving into the details, uncovering issues, and making things better. There’s something deeply satisfying about helping create digital experiences that actually work — smoothly, beautifully, reliably.  
This journey hasn't always been easy, but every challenge has taught me something valuable. QA has become more than just a profession — it feels like the right place for me.  
And I’m so excited to keep growing in it, step by step.

### <p align="center"><strong> My next big goal is to grow into an Automation QA role and make real impact in a tech team I belive in 🚀✨</strong></p>

## <p align="center"> FIRST AUTOMATION GOALS 🎯
1. Write simple automated test scripts. Start creating small scripts that can open a web page, click buttons, fill out forms, and check if elements appear correctly.
2. Understand the basics of test automation. Learn what test automation is, when to use it, and how it can help make testing faster and more reliable.
3. Study how to work with locators. Practice finding elements on a page using IDs, class names, CSS selectors — the foundation of interacting with any web element.
