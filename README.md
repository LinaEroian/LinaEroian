 ## Hello eveyone and welcome to my QA portfolio! 

# Hi there! I' am Lina - a passionate bug hunter 🕵️‍♀️. I love finding bugs so others don't have to! 
After long journey of late nights and lots of coffee I've found my passion in QA. I've taught myself everithing I know about it from scratch and I'm proud of how far I've come. 
I'am so exited to bring value to the team, make digital experiences better and smoother for everyone.
